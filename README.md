  * Outstanding first-line supervisors are essential to the success of any law enforcement agency, yet many officers lack the supervision training necessary to excel. Effective Police Supervision immerses readers in the group behaviors and organizational dynamics supervisors must master in order to lead their teams and to help create an effective police department. Combining behavioral theory and updated case studies, this core text, now in its eighth edition, is a vital tool for all college students pursuing criminal justice courses on supervisory practices, as well as police officers preparing for promotional exams.
